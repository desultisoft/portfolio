<p class= "demo-bullet">
    13 years of industry experience in a range of genres and platforms: PC (Windows, Mac), 
    Console (PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), Mobile (iOS, Android), AR (Magic Leap, iOS, Android), 
    VR (Oculus Quest, Rift) and analog games. The most popular ones are Forge of Empires, 8 Ball Pool, 
    Empire of Sin, SUPERHOT: The Card Game and Agent Decker. I’m currently working at Resolution Games. Previously at Romero Games, 
    InnoGames, Gambrinous, Digital Furnace, SixMinute, Miniclip and Gameinvest. Helping Game Dev Lisbon by organizing meetups and events for 
    the local game development scene, including the yearly Spotlight Awards. Previously on the board of Imirt, the Irish Game Makers Association, 
    in 2021/22, mostly running the Imirt Irish Game Awards, the Imirt Discord server and creating systems to automate the management 
    of both subscribers and newsletters. Even though the name of the page is “Games by Manuel”, most of the games on my portfolio were only 
    by working with teams of very talented individuals and it would be silly to take credit for the whole thing, 
    which is why I explain my role(s) in each project page.
