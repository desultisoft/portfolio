    My role in the project was to take the heroes, creatures and cards from the popular co-op dungeon crawler Demeo and remix them into a quick team-based competitive game. 
    This also included some necessary tweaks to a few cards and game mechanisms, and introruduced a few new elements such as the Burn, which pushes players closer together,
    the initial shop phase where players get set up before a match and a progression system to give players something to look forward to.
