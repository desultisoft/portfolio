    My role in the project was to develop the AI and building systems in the game. I used Unity's PlayMaker package to develop complex AI capable of handling player interruptions, multiple heuristic patterns, and interactions with the props
    the player would put into the world. I developed the prop placement of the building system as well as the architecture of the system that would allow for things like pathfinding and search algorithms of tiles.
